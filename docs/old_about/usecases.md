## **Instrumenting data pipelines**

When a discrepancy occurs in our data pipeline and you need to understand what has gone wrong, you can use Tile to create, persist, and share a report with your team.

## **Client sharing**

When you want to impress potential or existing customers with interactive data products in order to increase revenue/retention, you can use Tile to create interactive reports which you can share with them.

## **Programmatic reporting**

When you need to save time by automating report creation, you can use Tile to programmatically generate reports (instead of building them manually).

## **Self-service apps**

When we want non-technical people to be able to run advanced analytics for themselves, we can build them an app using Tile.

## **Ad-hoc internal reporting**

When you have completed an ad-hoc analysis and want to share your findings with someone non-technical, you can create them a report using Tile.
