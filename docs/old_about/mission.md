We believe the future of data analysis is open-source and developer-first: the best data teams will be software engineering teams. 

This is happening already. Open-source and code-first frameworks have revolutionized how we _extract_, _load_, and _analyze_ data. 

But there is one part of the stack that has very little developer-first tooling: the front-end. Sharing things in a code-first way is too hard and takes too long. Data teams lack the tools and frameworks for creating apps which web developers enjoy. This means jumping back to legacy UI-first tools, which lack the benefits of code-first. 

We think it's time for a radical new way to build data apps which borrows from the best practices of the web frameworks like Rails and Django. We think should be just as easy to whip up an app, dashboard, or report in Python as it is to create it in a drag and drop tool. We believe there is an opportunity to totally redefine the way data-focussed applications.

Tile's philosophy includes three guiding principles:

### Code-first
Tile is unashamadely code-first, which means that you have all of the benefits of versioning, testing, and collaboration which are absent in UI-first tools. It also makes it simple to create reports programmatically.

### Integrate with everything
Tile is built so you can generate and share reports from inside of wherever you already analyze data. You can immediately use tile inside of PySpark, Airflow, Jupyter, Colab, or Sagemaker.

Tile also renders the libraries you already use, like Pandas, Plotly, and Altair. The goal of the project is to have maximum compatibility with the rest of the data science ecosystem.

### Serverless
Not every interaction should require running a Python thread running in the cloud.

Tile believes in a separation of the presentation layer and execution layer. Tile views are compiled into interactive static pages which you can share as HTML documents or host on static sites. When building an app, execution happens in a serverless fashion.
