You can think of it as a data stack in a box . This stack is comprised of multiple open-source components which are integrated together using a unified API. Tile provides a simple way to define, configure, and run data products comprised of these components. Tile Project Architecture Tile is comprised of multiple components which help you build end-to-end data products. Analytics Code \u00b6 Tile uses Datapane to provide support for building web apps, reports, and dashboards. Web apps \u00b6 Build data web applications Reports and Dashboards \u00b6 Create interactive reports and dashboards using 100% Python, using popular Python data science libraries, such as Pandas, Altair, and Matplotlib. Datapane Components \u00b6 Datapane provides a suite of Python-based components and functions designed to perform live data analysis. Create and reuse components that allow you to process and analyze data in real-time, enabling them to uncover insights and make data-driven decisions quickly. By providing a Python-centric approach, your code can benefit from the language's extensive libraries and familiar syntax while building responsive, high-performance data-driven applications. Datapane Tasks \u00b6 Our open-source Python project includes features for managing background and scheduled tasks, which automate updates of datasets and the execution of analytics code. These capabilities allow developers to set up routine data refreshes and run analysis tasks without manual intervention, ensuring timely insights and efficient resource usage. By automating these processes, users can concentrate on exploring data and developing valuable applications, while the system effectively handles the underlying tasks. App Databases \u00b6 Your Data Products may need to store application-specific data independent of your analytics data, such as user preferences. Tile provides multiple persistance options for your Data Applications, including Document Databases (like Mongo DB), persistent caches, and Blob Storage (such as S3). These can be updated automatically, or as part of scheduled tasks, for instance, to update a trained model out-of-band for use within a Data Product. ELT \u00b6 Our ELT functionality empowers users to efficiently extract data from a wide array of sources, including databases, APIs, and file formats, ensuring seamless integration with virtually any data source. Once the data is extracted, it is loaded the projects OLAP DB for further transformation, allowing for tailored manipulation and analysis. By simplifying and automating the data ingestion process, Tile saves valuable time and resources, enabling data developers to focus on building applications and uncovering insights from their data. Orchestration \u00b6 Easily build, run, and orchestrate data pipelines - allowing you to efficiently manage, schedule, and monitor multiple data processing tasks, ensuring that dependencies are met and errors are handled gracefully. By automating and centralizing pipeline management, Tile projects eliminates manual intervention, reduces operational overhead, and accelerates uncovering insights. Transformations \u00b6 Make use of SQL and Python data transformations in your Tile project, enabling developers to harness the power of familiar query languages and scripting. This support allows for seamless manipulation and cleaning of data, catering to a wide range of analytical requirements. Benefit from the flexibility of both SQL and Python, and supercharge your data-driven applications with efficient, adaptable data transformations. Connections \u00b6 Tile comes with built-in support for Singer Taps and Meltano integrations, enabling seamless data connections withing your applications. Effortlessly connect to numerous data sources and benefit from streamlined data extraction, ensuring compatibility and adaptability for your data-driven applications. Capitalize on the convenience of reliable data connections and elevate your data workflows with our versatile integration options. OLAP Database \u00b6 We use DuckDB as our OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database - DuckDB provides efficient, multidimensional data analysis, making it easier to explore and manipulate large datasets in real-time. By integrating DuckDB, you can easily use both SQL and Python to rapidly work with large datasets, transform them and persist them trivially within your applications. Input / Output \u00b6 Notifications \u00b6 Tile offers support for popular communication channels like Slack, Teams, and Email. Use notifications to help users stay informed about the progress and status of their data-driven applications, as well as send timely alerts for critical events, errors, or triggers. By integrating these notification options, developers can ensure effective communication, improved collaboration, and prompt issue resolution within their teams. Integrations \u00b6 Tile comes with integrations built-in to work with external products, such as SaaS APIs, via webhooks. Python tasks can be scheduled to run in the background to perform batch processing. We also provide integrations into multiple LLMs via LangChain enabling the automated analysis of data. Management \u00b6 User Management \u00b6 Tile comes with user management out of the box, so you can efficiently handle permissions, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and SAML-based single sign-on. This functionality allows you to define and manage access levels for different users, ensuring data security and compliance within your application. By providing granular control over user access, developers can build Data Projects effectively while safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining a secure environment. Admin \u00b6 Tile provide essential tools for logging, monitoring, deployment, and versioning.

Much of this is in opposition to the large-scale, distributed, Big Data and micro-services-heavy \"Modern Data Stack\" we see today - we believe these often results in over-complex, fragile, and over-engineered systems that provide little value to their users or stakeholders. Single-node over multi-node \u00b6 Single node machines are really fast and just getting faster, yet tools like Spark turn all data processing issues into multi-node concerns. We think that as the core-counts increase and as tooling becomes more sophisticated, e.g. DuckDB and Apache Arrow, this tradeoff no longer makes sense for many traditional enterprise use-cases. The limits of what are possible on a single node machine, or even a developer laptop, are becoming far larger and can fit within a single node. Moving to multiple nodes drastically decreases latency whilst increasing the range of potential issues. Similar issues occur on the application side, where the general wisdom when building a complex data product with many endpoints, tasks, and integrations would be to use a tool like Kubernetes. However again we believe that for an internal enterprise use-case, it is much simpler and more reliable to use a fast, multi-core single node machine along with more low-maintenance deployment solutions like Docker. For Tile's on-prem and enterprise hosted options, we believe that as providing a single-node VM per customer is the right approach here, in terms of data isolation, performance, reliability, and ease of maintenance. The Modern Data Stack is overkill \u00b6 We don't believe that the \"Modern Data Stack\" - comprised of loading large amounts of data into Data Warehouses and Data Lakes like Snowflake or Redshift, then using tools like dbt and distributed processors like Spark, are suitable for all domains and scales. For most enterprise use-cases, especially for internal tooling that Tile is aimed at, e.g. Marketing HR Analytics, the datasets involved can fit within a single machine and we can utilize a much simpler and more reliable set of technologies, such as DuckDB and pandas. This is much simpler to manage and maintain, whilst still being faster for the intended use-cases. Python is the lingua franca for data analysis \u00b6 There are many languages that can be used for data analysis, such as R, Matlab, Julia, Scala and more - however we believe that Python is uniquely positioned to be the common language used for all data related tasks in the near-mid future. This is even more true as AI-generated code comes to the fore. The size of the Python community and strength of the ecosystem results in libraries and tools that support all data analytics tasks - including tools like Jupyter, ecosystems like Pandas, and libraries that support with ML, cloud infrastructure, SaaS APIs and more. BI tools based on SQL, such as Tableau, simply don't have the power, ecosystem, or flexibility to provide what is needed for modern companies to stay ahead. A Data Application Layer is not enough \u00b6 There are many tools for building \"data apps\" in Python to provide interactive plots and tables, such as Streamlit, Dash, Voila, and others. We believe that tools like Streamlit are great for quickly building demos and generating \"Interactive Powerpoints\" for data team to demo to stakeholders. However we've found they they are often of temporary use at the time and not maintained or used after. They are missing many features and suffer from design decisions that make them not capable of forming the basis of fully-featured internal data products. At Tile we have built Datapane, which is a really simple, React and HTMX-inspired data application framework that also provide a way to build reports, dashboards, and reusable components that can all be combined together to build interactive data driven applications directly in Python and Jupyter without requiring any Javascript. When used with Tile, Datapane supports a wide range of features required by product-grade data projects, including background tasks, integrated analytics databases, and user / permissions support. The Datapane server framework is a large and important part of the Tile data stack, which when combined with the other components in the system, allows you to easily build, deploy and run enterprise ready internal data applications rather than demos and \"Interactive Powerpoints\".","title":"Philosophy"},{"location":"philosophy/#single-node-over-multi-node","text":"Single node machines are really fast and just getting faster, yet tools like Spark turn all data processing issues into multi-node concerns.

You can test most of your project's application code locally during development, including using Datapanes inline Jupyter support. We recommend you build most of your Python code as functions, that you can easily mock and test during development to check that they are working as intended. Tile also supports building a mock version of your system for running locally via Docker, so you can test how your product operates as a whole when working with it locally. To do this, simply run, $ tile debug Building and Deployment \u00b6 Server Configuration \u00b6 To deploy your project, you first need to configure your Tile Server, this can be done by running the following from the command-line $ tile setup --server ${ SERVER } --token { $TOKEN } where $SERVER and $TOKEN are values taken from the Tile Server management console. Building \u00b6 Tile projects are built as a collection of networked and codependent container images that represent your entire project, from the Application code, to tasks, and ELT pipelines. The resulting images are pushed to Tile Server which runs them via our customized and robust container runtime system. Deployment \u00b6 To deploy your tile project, you can run the following from your project directory $ tile deploy [ --config config.py ] This will build and deploy your tile project to the Tile Server. From there you can configure it further and access it via the Tile Server interface. Note Deployment requires Docker to be installed, even on Windows and Mac. We generally recommend using the GitOps flow instead to simplify local requirements and enable a collaborative workflow Version Control and CI \u00b6 Tile used a GitOps workflow, where every Tile Project is intended to be committed and versioned via git . Upon pushing your changes upstream, we recommend setting up a CI flow, for instance via GitHub Actions, that automate testing your project and deploying it automatically. We have built a pre-ready GitHub Action that you can use directly within your pipelines to ease this process. You can configure the pipeline to deploy upon your own requirements, for instance upon a git tag or when pushing to a specific branch. The commit hash is used as a unique version of your Tile project that is used to version it upon deployment. The advantage of a GitOps flow is that you have a reproducible, audited and collaborative process to handle Tile deployments that is independent of your local developer environment. Updates \u00b6 When using a Git-based flow, updating your Tile project becomes very easy. Simply make your changes, commit and push to your upstream repo, triggering your automated deployment as needed. This results in a new version of the product being built and deployed to your Tile Server. Migrations \u00b6 As part of updating your code, you may need to run migration scripts to ensure that previously stored data is updated to work with the new analytics code. Tile supports migrations that can be run as part of a new deployment - these can be specified within the config.py and are run by the Server as needed.","title":"Lifecycle"},{"location":"dev/lifecycle/#code-development","text":"As described previously , it's easy to configure and build your Tile project.

Data teams lack the tools and frameworks for creating apps which web developers enjoy. This means jumping back to legacy UI-first tools, which lack the benefits of code-first. We think it's time for a radical new way to build data apps which borrows from the best practices of the web frameworks like Rails and Django. We think should be just as easy to whip up an app, dashboard, or report in Python as it is to create it in a drag and drop tool.

Out of the box, you can add formats such as: Pandas DataFrames Plots from Python visualization libraries such as Bokeh, Altair, Plotly, and Folium Markdown and text General files, such as images, PDFs, JSON data, etc Tile also provides a rich selection of layout and interactive components, such as grids, dropdowns, selects, and a fully interactive DataTable. Views can replace creating a report in a BI tool, such as Looker or Tableau. import tile_dev as t import snowflake.connector from internal_lib import forecast conn = snowflake . connector . connect ( ... ) users = conn . execute_query ( 'get_users.sql' ) . fetchall () f_data , f_plot = forecast . predict ( df ) sales_v_profit = alt .

They are portable, scalable, and fast to create. But eventually you might need your end-users to be able to run your Python script or Jupyter Notebook themselves. Expanding on the above example, we can add a dynamic form to our view which users can run with parameters. analysis.ipynb # API TBD - this is a mock! import tile_dev as t import snowflake.connector from internal_lib import forecast conn = snowflake . connector . connect ( ... ) users = conn . execute_query ( 'get_users.sql' ) . fetchall () sales_v_profit = alt .
